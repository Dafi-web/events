# 🚀 Push This Fix and Deploy!

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

The error was: **"Cannot find module 'express'"**

**Root Cause:** The build command was changing directories (`cd server`) but the installed node_modules weren't persisting correctly.

**Solution Applied:** Added `rootDir: server` to `render.yaml` so Render knows to work from the server directory.

---

## 📋 What You Need To Do Now (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/dawitabrhaweldegebriel/Desktop/OneTigray
git push origin main
```

You should see:
```
✅ Committed: "Fix render.yaml - add rootDir to properly set working directory"
```

---

### Step 2: Update Render Settings (IMPORTANT!)

Go to: https://dashboard.render.com → Your Service (events-1)

#### A. Update Build & Start Commands

Click **"Settings"** tab and update:

**Build Command:**
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
(Remove the `cd server &&` part!)

**Start Command:**
```
npm start
```
(Remove the `cd server &&` part!)

**Root Directory:**
```
server
```
(Set this to `server`)

#### B. Add Environment Variables

Click **"Environment"** tab and add:

```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://wediabrhana_db_user:yesno1212@cluster0.zdrbe3u.mongodb.net/onetigray?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

JWT_SECRET = afdea6a02dcc97a4f95c6fefb74f62486a7c58e778ba54a3cc275be49a53faac

NODE_ENV = production
```

#### C. Save & Deploy

1. Click **"Save Changes"**
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. Watch the logs

## ✅ Expected Success Logs

You should see:

```
==> Building...
Building in: /opt/render/project/src/server
Running: npm install --legacy-peer-deps

added 150 packages in 25s

==> Build successful 🎉

==> Deploying...
Running: npm start

## 🎯 Quick Summary of Changes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `buildCommand: cd server && npm install` | `buildCommand: npm install` |
| `startCommand: cd server && npm start` | `startCommand: npm start` |
| No rootDir | `rootDir: server` ✅ |

**Why this works:** `rootDir: server` tells Render "treat the server folder as the root directory for this service" so all commands run from there automatically.

---

## 🔍 Test After Deployment

Once deployed, test your backend:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://events-1.onrender.com/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "database": "Connected",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

Or visit in browser:
```
https://events-1.onrender.com/health
https://events-1.onrender.com/api
```

## 🆘 If It Still Fails

Check these in order:

### 1. MongoDB Connection Issue?
**Error:** "MongoDB connection failed"

**Fix:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Select "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
4. Save and wait 2-3 minutes

### 2. Environment Variables Missing?
**Error:** "Missing required environment variables"

**Fix:** Double-check you added all 3 required variables:
- MONGODB_URI ✓
- JWT_SECRET ✓
- NODE_ENV ✓

### 3. Still Module Not Found?
**Error:** "Cannot find module..."

**Fix:** 
1. Clear build cache: Settings → "Clear build cache & deploy"
2. Make sure Root Directory is set to `server`
3. Make sure build command is just `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
